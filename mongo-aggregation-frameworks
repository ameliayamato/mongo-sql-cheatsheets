#In SQL COUNT(*) and with GROUP BY is basically the same as mongo's aggregation
#Basic basic syntax of aggregate() method:
db.collection.aggregate(aggregation_operation)

#Let's say we have a collection students
#If I want to display a list of how many submissions each student made, I would write the the following: 

db.students.aggregate([{$group: {_id:"$student_name", numSubs: {$sum: 1}}}]);
# Over here, I'm using student_name as a field, which will replace the _id part in the query output
